Purpose
_______
Using a password to regularly log into a computer can cause trouble for a user, especially if a computer quickly locks. Yet too often computers are left unattended without being locked. Unlocked computers allow anyone to access the information and applications open on a system. A point of sale (POS) system, tax information, and even an employee’s personal information will be available to anyone who walks up to an unattended enterprise workstation. This Sub-Control applies to more than just a computer system since smartphones and tablets can also be left unlocked. 

This Sub-Control is important because it protects from very basic, low-effort, and easy to do attacks. People with very little technical skill can walk up to a computer and access a company’s information if there is no lock on the system. If someone with technical knowledge accessed a system without a lockscreen, depending on how the computer is setup, they can install malware and potentially access passwords used by employees. In a worst-case scenario, they can potentially bring enterprise computer systems and networks down if passwords are reused or if the computer they are on is setup to manage other devices. 

Automation
__________
This type of policy can be controlled and monitored automatically if you have your systems joined to a domain. This is a fairly basic configuration setting that can be completely accomplished automatically.

Guidance and Tools 
__________________
There is no universally agreed upon time frame for how quickly a computer should lock. Locking after one or two minutes of inactivity may be too quick, and cause frustration while trying to read emails, articles, and spreadsheets. Many organizations recommend 5 minutes as a balance between security and usability. With that said, the following should be kept in mind:

* All computers, phones, and tablets should have their settings changed to lock after a predetermined time. Although you may not be able to enforce it, at least asking employees who use their phones to access work emails to put a password or lock on their personal phones and tablets.
* Employees should be regularly reminded of the dangers of leaving their computer systems unlocked.
