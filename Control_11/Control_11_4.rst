Purpose
_______
Network devices include wireless routers, sometimes called wireless access points, and the networking appliance provided from an Internet service provider (ISP). An ISP is a telecommunications company that provides access to the Internet for companies and individuals. ISP provided appliances are confusingly referred to by multiple interchangeable terms such as modem or cable box. Some ISPs can provide a single network device that acts as modem, wireless access point, and firewall all in one. Regardless, all networking equipment needs to be regularly updated – even devices from the ISP. To update the software or firmware on any of these network appliances, it will often be necessary to access the device via an administrator account. This is commonly done via a web browser. The correct settings to update the system will be provided by the relevant ISP and/or network device manufacturer.

Older software on wireless access points and cable boxes or modems can lead to a malicious actor accessing sensitive enterprise information via the device. This can occur via vulnerabilities in protocols supported by the router or how users are authenticated to the router. If an attacker gains access to the device, they may be able to change network passwords, grant any computer access to the network, or potentially modify data in transit.

Automation
__________
The degree of automatability available for this Sub-Control depends on the network appliances that are in use within an organization. Some network appliances can be set to auto-update all software and firmware. Others will not have this capability and will need to be manually updated on a regular basis.
