Procedural 

Purpose
_______
During an incident, many important decisions will need to be made in a short timeframe.  For this reason, it is necessary for management personnel with the authority to make those decisions to be involved in the incident handling process.  Designated management personnel should have a clear understanding of their role in the process ahead of time, before incidents occur.  Backup personnel should also be designated in case the corresponding primary personnel are unavailable when an incident arises.

Automation
__________
There is no way to automate this this Sub-Control. Yet this does not mean that an incident response plan and associated response procedures must be made from scratch. It is possible to obtain incident response procedures from other similar organizations that already have them in place. These procedures likely nominate management and technical roles for certain response positions, and these can be can be modified to fit an organizationâ€™s needs.
