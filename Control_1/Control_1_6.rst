Once an inventory of authorized assets is established, it’s possible to make a list of unauthorized assets connected to a network. Any device on the list, including phones, tablets, and laptops, should be investigated. It is possible that a device under investigation is actually authorized to be there, at which point it can be removed from the list. If a device is not meant to be on the network, it should be removed from the network and thoroughly investigated. Unauthorized devices may be accessing enterprise network traffic, including proprietary or sensitive information. They also are in position on the network from which to launch attacks and hack into organizational systems. 
Physically finding a device can be a difficult task, as it’s often hard to associate a device name (e.g., John’s Android) or network identifier (e.g., MAC address) to a particular device by sight. Device names and MAC addresses can provide hints to the type of device, but they can also be faked to fool anyone trying to find the device. Changing a WiFi password may be a useful step to take if you’re unable to find the device in question, but that may only sometimes work, and it only pertains to wireless devices. 
This Sub-Control helps to prevent unauthorized eavesdroppers on a public network. Attackers might be able to view enterprise traffic, or change it while it’s being sent. Eavesdroppers can be listening on the wired and wireless network.
