Welcome to The CIS Windows 10 Implementation Guide!
=================================================
In this document, guidance is provided on how to apply the security best practices found in CIS Controls Version 7.1 to Windows 10 Pro environments. As a non-profit driven by its volunteers, we are always in the process of looking for new topics and assistance in creating cybersecurity guidance. If you are interested in volunteering and/or have questions, comments, or have identified ways to improve this guide, please write us at controlsinfo@cisecurity.org.
